My name is Aanya Gupta, and I'm a senior! I absolutely love coding and have quite a bit of coding experience; I've learnt python, know how to build a website with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning java! 

### My Background

Iâ€™m of Indian origin, however, I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for 8 years in addition to Londdon, Singapore, and now New York! This has been my favourite place to live!

### My Hobbies

In school, I love learning about STEM subjects, including app development, mathematics, and biology! Outside of school, I enjoy coding, playing volleyball (GO LIONS!), singing, dancing, and reading!
