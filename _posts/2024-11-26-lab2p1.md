First, I spent some time exploring the given World Bank website because there were a ton of links that took me to various places. Next, I browsed through the indicators list and looked at the different representations of each dataset (graphs, XML, etc). 

The 5 indicators I ended up choosing were:

1. Central government debt (% of GDP)
1. Population in slums (% of urban population)
1. Primary school enrollment (% net)
1. Primary school completion rate (% of relevant age group)
1. Kids in employment (% of children ages 7-14)

I chose these indicators because one of my interests has always been child welfare and what influences/impacts it. In the future, I would be curious to analyze the data obtained from this assignment to determine if there is a strong correlation between any of the indicators. 

I looked at the range of years included in each dataset, and found that there was data from:

1. 1970-2022
1. 2000-2020
1. 1970-2019
1. 1970-2023
1. 1994-2016

I decided that I would pull data from 2000-2016 because all 5 datasets cover those years. 

I decided to pick 6 countries, because that seemed like a reasonable number. I wanted to pull data for countries with different GDPs (per capita), from very high to very low. 

So, I went to [this website](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/) and chose 6 countries that were evenly spread out from the ranking of 1-177 (based on GDP). 

I selected:

1. USA
1. India
1. Bangladesh
1. Argentina
1. Kenya
1. Costa Rica

After I had decided my indicators, years, and countries for filtering my data, I got to coding! 

## Task 1

After referring to the class and str method I wrote for my Pokemon assignment, I wrote the `CountryYear` class–defining the required indicators (detailed in Q1) and my 5 additional ones–and str method for this lab. 

```
class CountryYear:
   def __init__(self, name, country_iso3, year, life_expectancy, gdp_per_capita, population, central_gov_debt, pop_in_slums, prim_schl_enrollment, prim_complete_rate, kids_in_employ):
       ## Required indicators
       self.name = str(name)
       self.country_iso3 = str(country_iso3)
       self.year = int(year)
       self.life_expectancy = float(life_expectancy)
       self.gdp_per_capita = float(gdp_per_capita)
       self.population = int(population)
       ## My indicators
       self.central_gov_debt = central_gov_debt
       self.pop_in_slums = pop_in_slums
       self.prim_schl_enrollment = prim_schl_enrollment
       self.prim_complete_rate = prim_complete_rate
       self.kids_in_employ = kids_in_employ

   def __str__(self):
       return f"{self.name},{self.country_iso3},{self.year},{self.life_expectancy},{self.gdp_per_capita},{self.population},{self.central_gov_debt},{self.pop_in_slums},{self.prim_schl_enrollment},{self.prim_complete_rate},{self.kids_in_employ}"
```  

## Tasks 2 and 3

Then, I began writing the `get_world_bank_data(indicator)` method. I started by defining the query parameters, which were country, indicator, year, and format of the data (JSON). I wanted the obtained data to be put into a nested dictionary, so I created one where the data would be stored in `data[country][year]`. Then, I queried my API accordingly through the URL and parsed the JSON response. However, I later realized that this code did not include every page containing the data I needed (how I fixed it is detailed farther below). 

I knew I needed to find a way to map the indicator names to their API codes, so I defined a new method. 

```
@classmethod
    def def_cont_yr_objects(cls, countries, years):
        indicators = {
            "life_expectancy": "SP.DYN.LE00.IN",
            "gdp_per_capita": "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD",
            "population": "SP.POP.TOTL",
            "central_gov_debt": "GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS",
            "pop_in_slums": "EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS",
            "prim_schl_enrollment": "SE.PRM.ENRR",
            "prim_complete_rate": "SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS",
            "kids_in_employ": "SL.TLF.0714.ZS",
        }
```

I didn’t know how to actually get the data from the website for all the indicators into the nested dictionary, so I looked it up online. 

```
data_tot = {key: cls.get_world_bank_data(indicator, countries, years) for key, indicator in indicators.items()}
```

After that, I defined the CountryYear objects for each country and year using the data that was pulled from the website (stored in the nested dictionary). I forgot how to pull data from nested dictionaries (oops), so I visited another website to see how I could do it. 

```
country_year_objects = []
        for country in countries:
            for year in years:
                country_year = cls(
                    name = country,
                    country_iso3 = country,
                    year = year,
                    life_expectancy = data_tot["life_expectancy"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    gdp_per_capita = data_tot["gdp_per_capita"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    population = data_tot["population"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    central_gov_debt = data_tot["central_gov_debt"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    pop_in_slums = data_tot["pop_in_slums"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    prim_schl_enrollment = data_tot["prim_schl_enrollment"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    prim_complete_rate = data_tot["prim_complete_rate"].get(country, {}).get(year, ""),
                    kids_in_employ = data_tot["kids_in_employ"].get(country, {}).get(year, "")
                )
                country_year_objects.append(country_year)
        return country_year_objects
```

I began creating the csv file in which my data would be stored by defining another method, where I stated the headers of each of the columns. Subsequently, I wrote the data into the csv file using `csv.writer` (I learned about the function online). 

```
 @staticmethod
    def save_to_csv(country_year_objects, filename):
        headers = ["name", "country_iso3", "year", "life_expectancy", "gdp_per_capita", "population", "central_gov_debt",
                   "pop_in_slums", "prim_schl_enrollment", "prim_complete_rate", "kids_in_employ"]
        with open(filename, "w") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file) 
            writer.writerow(headers)
            for obj in country_year_objects:
                writer.writerow([
                    obj.name, obj.country_iso3, obj.year, obj.life_expectancy, obj.gdp_per_capita, obj.population,
                    obj.central_gov_debt, obj.pop_in_slums, obj.prim_schl_enrollment, obj.prim_complete_rate, obj.kids_in_employ
                ])
```

Next, I defined the countries and years that I wanted to include like so: 

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    countries = ["USA", "IND", "BGD", "ARG", "KEN", "CRI"]
    years = range(2000, 2017)
```

Finally, I made the CountryYear objects and saved my csv file. 

```
country_year_data = CountryYear.def_cont_yr_objects(countries, years)
    CountryYear.save_to_csv(country_year_data, "country_years.csv")
```

I didn’t know that I needed to write `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` on top of each “section” of code, which is why it initially did not work. However, after asking Alisa, I added them, tweaked the code accordingly, and it ran smoothly!

Though, I realized I wasn’t finished yet. The default number of results per page is 50, and you can get more results by going through each page. I realised that my code did not guarantee full coverage of the results, and so I wrote code to ensure that all the pages were read. 

```
@staticmethod
    def get_world_bank_data(indicator, countries, years):
        data = {country: {year: "" for year in years} for country in countries}
        for country in countries:
            for year in years:
                url = f"http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{country}/indicator/{indicator}?date={year}&format=json"
                response = requests.get(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    try:
                        record = response.json()[1][0] 
                        if "value" in record:
                            data[country][year] = record["value"] 
                    except (IndexError, TypeError):
                        pass

        return data
```

I ran the code and checked to make sure the CSV was working correctly, and I noticed that there was a large gap in the data for the US. I talked to Ms. Feng about it, and she said that it was okay, since I had other countries that had a good amount of data. 

## Conclusion

In this lab, I learned how to use the resources available to me and think creatively about problems given a specific set of tools. Additionally, I learned how to effectively use nested dictionaries, define methods, pull data using APIs, and add that data to CSV files! There’s probably a shorter way to achieve the same goal, but I wasn’t sure of what that way was. As mentioned in my last lab, as we learn more tools, I can come back to this and apply what I've learned to shorten my code. This was another fun lab!
