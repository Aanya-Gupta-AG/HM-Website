First, I read the assignment description, and realized that I needed to find a dataset! 

## Initial Research:

I knew that I wanted to find something related to education, because I’m interested in learning how lifestyle factors may impact academic outcomes, and to what degree they do.

First, I went on Github to search for datasets. However, all of those under the “Education” section were not suitable for a variety of reasons, including not being downloadable as a csv file. 

Next, I went on Kaggle, and I found a dataset that I liked. Titled "Daily Lifestyle and Academic Performance of Students," it presents data collected from 2,000 students–primarily living in India–regarding the number of hours per day spent studying, sleeping, socializing, attending extracurricular activities, and completing physical activity, as well as their stress levels and cumulative GPA. 

After reading through the dataset, I became interested in analyzing the relationships between these students’ GPAs and the other variables listed above, respectively. 

## Analyzing the Data:

### Finding General Statistics

First, I statistically analyzed the dataset. To do so, I referred back to our past assignments from this unit, and I found that `.describe()` would do the job! 

I gained the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and the center and variability of all the quantitative variables (so, all the variables except stress levels). 

The count was 2,000 for every variable, which makes sense given the 2,000 responses received to collect this data. 

*I’ll refer back to these values when analyzing specific relationships!*

### Finding Correlations

Initially, I wasn’t sure which specific relationships I wanted to analyze. Hence, I found the correlation coefficients between GPA and all the other quantitative variables. I did this using `.corr()`.

I found that Hours of Studying Per Day and Hours of Physical Activity Per Day had the strongest linear correlations with GPA, while the remaining quant. variables had almost no linear correlation with it. 

Next, I graphed each correlation to confirm my theory. 

### Visualizing the Dataset

Since I was finding the relationships between two quantitative variables, I decided to use scatter plots. Using `sns.scatterplot()`, I graphed GPA on the y-axis, and the other variable on the x-axis. Then, I used .set() to add titles. 

Visually, I found that GPA vs Hours of Studying and Hours of Physical Activity (respectively) had the most evident relationships, while GPA vs the other quant. variables showed no correlations. 

Next, I graphed GPA vs Stress Levels using a different method. Since I was graphing a quantitative and categorical variable, I decided to use a violin plot. I did this with `sns.violinplot()` and `.set()`. While I got the correct graph, the violin plots were ordered incorrectly. Thus, I used pd.Categorical() to fix that! 

After looking at the graph, I thought that there was a correlation between the variables.

### Which variables did I end up analyzing?

From all the evidence gathered, I decided to pursue analyzing the relationships between GPA vs Hours of Studying, Hours of Physical Activity, and Stress Levels (respectively). 

### Generating Regression Lines 

I decided to graph regression lines for GPA vs Study Hrs. and Physical Activity Hrs (respectively) using `sns.regplot()`. While I obtained lines, the data points were covering them, so I reduced their opacity using `scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.005})`

### Creating Distribution Graphs

After beginning to analyze the data, I realized that I should create distribution graphs for Study hours and Activity hours. Thus, I used `sns.histplot()` and `.set()` to do so! 

## Determining the Specific Relationships

### GPA and Hours of Studying:

![studydist](/assets/studydist.png)

The mean of the dataset was found to be ~7.5, which means that students averaged 7.5 hours of studying on a daily basis, with the minimum being 5 hours and the maximum being 10 hours. The standard deviation was found to be ~1.4, which means for a normal distribution, Ms. Feng said that 65% of students studied within 1.4 hours of the mean (~6 or ~8.8 hours). However, as shown by the distribution, this isn’t a normal one! From the graph, it can be concluded that the students were generally distributed equally across the hours of studying gathered. 

![study](/assets/study.png)

From the scatter plot–as shown by the generally upward trend in the points and the positive slope of the linear regression line–as hours of studying increased, GPA increased as well. Coupled with the determined correlation coefficient of 0.734468, it could be determined that a significant, direct, and positive relationship exists between GPA and Hours of Studying. This makes sense not only because other studies have validated this relationship, but also because if you study more, you’ll probably get better grades. Of course, it also depends on how good their studying skills are, but generally speaking, the former explanation holds. 

### GPA and Hours of Physical Activity:

![exercisedist](/assets/exercisedist.png)

The mean of the dataset was found to be ~4.3, which means that students averaged 7.5 hours of physical activity on a daily basis, with the minimum being 0 hours and the maximum being 13 hours. The standard deviation was found to be ~2.5, which means for a normal distribution, 65% of students exercised within 2.5 hours of the mean (~1.8 or ~6.8 hours). However, again, as shown by the distribution, this isn’t a normal one! From the graph, it can be concluded that the data is skewed right, which means there is more outlying data to the right of the graph. 

![exercise](/assets/exercise.png)

From the visualised graph–as shown by the generally downward trend in the points and the negative slope of the linear regression line–as hours of physical activity increased, GPA decreased. Coupled with the determined correlation coefficient of -0.341152, it could be determined that a significant, inverse, and negative relationship exists between GPA and Hours of Physical Activity. This makes sense because if you spend more time working out, then you have less time to study, and from the correlation found above, that would result in a lower GPA. 

### GPA and Stress Levels:

![stress](/assets/stress.png)

From reports of low stress, the violin plot shows that the GPA distribution was quite compact, and the median GPA was ~2.8. For moderate stress, the distribution was higher than that of low stress (meaning a higher minimum and maximum GPA), and the median GPA was a little lower than 3.0. For high stress, the distribution was the longest, and the median GPA was just below 3.25. However, the spread was much larger, indicating a higher variability in GPAs for people experiencing high stress. This shows that high stress can lead to some students majorly succeeding and others struggling. (More about this graph can be found in the next section)

## Limitations:

From the violin plot, while the mean GPA was shown to increase as stress level increased, the variability means that further tests (which we haven’t learned yet) would need to be conducted in order to confirm a specific relationship. 

It is also important to note that we have proved that the data was found to be correlational, but not causational. Therefore, further tests (which we haven’t learned yet) would need to be conducted in order to prove the explained relationships. 

Additionally, the relationships determined assume that the students’ current–at the time–habits were constant throughout their high school career. For example, a student might have a low cumulative GPA due to past bad habits. However, at the time that this data was collected, they could have changed and started getting better grades, which could not be accounted for in the dataset or its analysis. One way of combatting this would have been by measuring the students’ GPAs for the semester, instead of one which reflects their entire high school career. 

## Conclusions

From analyzing GPA vs Study Hours, we found that students averaged 7.5 hours of studying on a daily basis and identified a significant, direct, and positive relationship between the variables. From looking at GPA vs Physical Activity hours, we learned that students averaged 7.5 hours of physical activity on a daily basis, and found a significant, inverse, and negative relationship. From looking at GPA vs Stress Levels, high stress was found to lead to some students majorly succeeding and others struggling. However, a decisive relationship could not be drawn. 

Overall, I think I did well on this lab; I was able to learn from my past labs and make my code and my writing more concise!! Yay!! In terms of next steps, I would like to learn more tests that we can conduct in order to have greater supporting evidence for my claims!
