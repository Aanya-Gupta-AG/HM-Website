First, I read the assignment description, and realized that I needed to find a scientific research paper!

From taking “Molecular Genetics: Cells and Physiology” last year, I knew that I wanted to find a paper about protein denaturation/refolding for this assignment; it was definitely one of the most interesting units we studied. With that in mind, I searched known scientific databases (PNAS, Nature, ScienceDirect, etc) for papers matching that topic, and I found a really interesting one!

Here is the link: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0911610107#sec-1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0911610107#sec-1)

# About the Paper

In this paper, titled “Protein refolding by pH-triggered chaperone binding and release,” one of the main experimental questions that the researchers were trying to answer was: What is the role of the chaperone protein HdeA in assisting the refolding of and preventing the accumulation of acid-denatured proteins? Can it do so independently of ATP after its environment has shifted from an acidic pH to a neutral pH?

The answers to these questions (thus, the data obtained from this study) are important because they could provide further insight into the role of chaperone proteins in protein folding and could clarify/reaffirm existing ideas on how protein folding and refolding occur in a cell. The mechanisms of protein folding and refolding are important because without them, life would quite literally cease to exist; these mechanisms allow for polypeptide chains to coil into specific proteins. So, in their absence, proteins would not be able to be formed, thus leading our bodies to have no functionality (that is, if they can even be created without these crucial proteins).

In this study, while the researchers had a central question, they conducted multiple, different experiments in order to answer it, with each one contributing a separate (yet connected) idea to their final claim. Ms Feng said that I could focus on one experiment, and so I picked Experiment “2” (which has the subheading “HdeA Supports Refolding of Acid-Unfolded MDH to the Native State”). 

*Note: Experiment 2 consists of 2 sub-experiments (A and B, as shown in Figure 2).*

# About Experiment 2 (A and B)

In experiment 2A, the researchers were trying to test whether HdeA could provide enough support to an acid-denatured substrate–Porcine mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH)–for it to renature or refold into its original structure. Similarly, in experiment 2B, the researchers were trying to test whether HdeA could provide enough support to another acid-denatured substrate–Alkaline phosphatase (AP)–for it to renature or refold.

## Hypotheses

The researchers’ alternative hypothesis was that HdeA would not be able to assist in MDH/AP’s protein refolding processes after neutralization of the pHs of the solutions, which they hypothesized due to a finding that denatured HdeA could not refold into its original shape when in an environment with a neutral pH. 

Although it is not stated, it is thus implied that the null hypothesis was that HdeA would be able to assist in MDH/AP’s protein refolding processes after neutralization of the pHs of the solutions. 

## Methodologies

They tested their hypothesis using a four step process: 

For experiment A, they first denatured MDH by putting it in a pH 2 buffer solution for 1 hour at 37°C. Using this solution, they created four solutions containing different ratios of HdeA to MDH; the first had a ratio of 2:1; the second had one of 1:1; the third had one of 1:2; the fourth had one of 0:1. After that, they neutralized the pH of all the solutions at 20°C so that MDH could begin its renaturation (or refolding) process. Finally, they measured the percent recovered activity of MDH, recording the data at regular time intervals. For experiment B, the same procedure (as in the first experiment) was followed using AP instead of MDH. 

For both experiments, the aspects tested were classified as follows:

* The independent variables were the ratio of HdeA to MDH/AP in each of the four solutions and the acid-denatured substrate’s refolding time. 
* The dependent variable of this experiment was the percent activity recovered of MDH.
* The controlled variables of this experiment were the concentration of MDH/AP and that of the buffer solution of pH 2, and the temperatures at which MDH/AP was denatured and those at which the solution was neutralized. 
* The control group of this experiment was the fourth solution in which the ratio of HdeA to MDH/AP was 0:1, and the addition of another protein BSA, which was not a known substrate.

As shown above, the researchers collected their own data. Although they compressed their data into a certain number of graphs, the complete dataset (in the form of graphs) with a summary of all of their data is available to the public in the supplementary write-up attached to this paper. However, the exact values are not included, and so it is not a raw dataset, but most scientific papers do not include exact values (which is a whole other problem to tackle, I guess…). After reading the packet, I found that all of the data they recorded for experiment 2 was included in their main paper. Yay! Though, it is important to note that we will never *really* know if the *whole* dataset is included in these graphs.

## Analysis of Results

As shown in Figure 2A (representing experiment A), the researchers found that when HdeA was not present, a low percentage of activity of MDH was recovered (less than 5%). This makes sense because while there was no other protein present to aid MDH in refolding, it still had the ability to spontaneously fold to some degree. However, as seen in the graphs of the first, second, and third solutions, when HdeA was present, there was a significantly greater percentage of activity of MDH recovered, with the highest recovery percentage being almost 50% when the ratio of HdeA to MDH was 2:1 (first solution). This makes sense because as more HdeA was present and available, more substrates would have been able to bind with them and thus have their protein folding processes facilitated and stabilized by HdeA, resulting in the observed increase in the percent recovered activity of MDH as the concentration of HdeA increased per solution. Additionally, it was found that along with the increase in recovered activity and concentration of HdeA, the refolding time decreased. This makes sense because continuing from the logic used above, the fact that there were more protein folding processes being facilitated by HdeA indicates that less time would have been taken to regain a given amount of protein activity, which explains the observed decrease in folding time. Moreover, the fact that HdeA was even able to facilitate protein folding processes (as shown in the percent activity recovered for the first three solutions) answers the researchers’ main experimental question, showing that HdeA can independently do so in the absence of ATP. 

As shown in Figure 2B (representing experiment A), the researchers similarly found that when HdeA was not present, a low percentage of activity of AP was recovered (less than 10%). This makes sense because while there was no other protein present to aid AP in refolding, it still had the ability to spontaneously fold to some degree. However, as seen in the graphs of the first, second, and third solutions, when HdeA was present, there was an even greater percentage of activity of AP recovered than of MDH, with the highest recovery percentage being greater than 50% when the ratio of HdeA to AP was 2:1 (first solution). Hence, similar to the first experiment–it is evident that as the concentration of HdeA increased, the percentage of activity recovered increased as well, and consequently, the refolding time decreased for the same reasoning as explained in the analysis of the first experiment. 

An overall takeaway from both experiments is that with the shift from an acidic pH to a neutral pH, HdeA was able to assist in the protein refolding of acid-denatured MDH and AP. The results clearly contrast from the researchers’ initial hypothesis that HdeA would not be able to assist in MDH/AP’s protein refolding processes after neutralization of the pHs of the solutions. 

For both experiments, statistical significance was derived from “2-DSA data refinement using genetic algorithms followed by 50 Monte Carlo simulations.” From this data analysis, the authors calculated error bars for their data, and found a standard deviation of +/- 1. This means that 68% of the data was +/- 1 away from the mean, which is pretty good, in my opinion. 

# Can we replicate this study?

Given the credibility of the researchers’ methodology and results (as demonstrated above), I think that it is possible to replicate this study if one is given the proper tools and has adequate knowledge on the subject to draw conclusions from the numbers!

# Factors that contributed negatively to whether I trusted this study or not: 

* The researchers did not include their raw data in their supporting packet of data. 
* Limitations: While the authors included possible avenues of research from what they found in this study, they didn’t state any limitations of their study. Scientific experiments are rarely perfect (if not, always imperfect in some way), and so it’s not possible that they did not have a single limitation. 

# Other factors taken into account when deciding whether I trusted this study or not:

* The authors do not state any conflict of interest anywhere in the paper of supporting information. However, there’s no clear evidence as to whether there actually was or was not any conflict of interest. 
* “Publish or Perish:” This phrase describes the pressure to publish a paper in a well known journal in order to “succeed” as a scientific researcher. Oftentimes, the papers that come as a result of this phrase are those which are inaccurate in some way (some data has been excluded and purposefully not mentioned anywhere, the data was “fudged” to make scientific sense, etc, so that the paper is published). Realistically, there’s no way to determine if “Publish or Perish” affected this study given that their methodologies, results, and analyses make scientific sense. 
  * Think about it: there’s no way to *prove* that the data is real, for example, unless we have video evidence of the researchers obtaining their results. 
  * However, the credibility of the article as a whole makes me think that “Publish or Perish” most likely did not greatly affect this paper. 

# THE MOMENT WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR: TO TRUST OR NOT TO TRUST?

Short answer: I trust this source!

Long answer: As demonstrated above, the reasons for trusting this source far outweigh and outnumber the reasons for not trusting this source; the journal, authors, funding, and results are credible and make scientific sense. Additionally, the data is public and the study can be replicated. Thus, I trust this source!
